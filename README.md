### A minimal theme for HUGO static site generator

After attempting to build my own personal website by getting inspiration from various minimalistic themes for Hugo, I decided to convert my own design into a theme for Hugo so that it can be used by anyone.

When ready, the theme will still be using Semantic-UI CSS framework for styling and responsiveness and Javascript for the various interactive parts (if any; it's still a work in progress).

You can try it on your own by:

- Installing Hugo on your computer (more info for the installation process on Hugo's website) 
- Opening a terminal or command prompt (for windows) and typing:
    
    > Hugo new site 'name of your site' (without the quotes)

- Git clone this repository on the theme folder
- Type the following command to run a local server to preview it:
    
    > Hugo Server
